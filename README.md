# Client solution for e-conomic hiring task

As a part of the e-conomic/sproom recruitment process we ask our candidates to complete a practical development challenge. The challenge consists of two parts:

User Stories:

1. As a freelancer I want to be able to register how I spend time on my _projects_, so that I can provide my _customers_ with an overview of my work.
2. As a freelancer I want to be able to get an _overview of my time registrations per project_, so that I can create correct invoices for my customers.
3. As a freelancer I want to be able to _sort my projects by their deadline_, so that I can prioritise my work.

Individual time registrations should be 30 minutes or longer, and once a project is complete it can no longer receive new registrations. You do not need to create an actual invoice.
